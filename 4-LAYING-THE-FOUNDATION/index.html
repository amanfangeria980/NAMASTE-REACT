    <!-- A polyfill in JavaScript is a piece of code (or a script) that provides modern features to older browsers that don't inherently support those features. These features might be new JavaScript language features, APIs, or methods introduced in newer versions of browsers or the ECMAScript specification. -->

    <!-- Babel does this  -->

    <!-- Babel is a tool used in modern web development to help make sure that the new, shiny code you write can be understood by older web browsers that might not know how to handle it. -->

    <!-- Sure, think of a polyfill like a translator for old web browsers. Imagine you're speaking a new language with fancy words that some people don't understand. A polyfill is like a person who listens to what you're saying and then explains it in a way those people can understand. In the same way, a polyfill is a bit of extra code that helps old web browsers understand and use new tricks and features that they normally wouldn't be able to understand. This helps websites work well on both old and new browsers. -->

    <!-- We have addedg a start script in package.json, now to run, type :: npm run start or npm start-->

    <!-- npm start: This command is used to start your application according to what's defined in the "scripts" section of your project's package.json file. For example, if you have a script called "start" defined like this, thus, we cannot use npx start as npx expects an executable command from a package, not a script name -->

    <!-- parcel itself doesn't remove any console logs, we need to install and configure babel plugin for that, reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-remove-consoles -->
